              "\"I am agree the tightly defined curriculum of our education system leaves no room for imagination and creativity.A hidden curriculum can be defined as the lesson that are taught informally,and usually unintentionally in the school and colleges. These include behaviour ,perspectives and attitudes that students pick up while they are at school.This is contrasted with the formal curriculum,such as the courses and activities students participate in,The curriculum began early in the child's education. Students learn to form opinion and ideas about their environment and their classmate.They also learn what is expected of them.These attitudes and ideas are not taught in formal way,but kids absorb them through natural observation and participation in classroom more and more and also participate in social activities.Areas of hidden curriculum in our school that mold perspectives of students deal with issues such as gender,morals,social class,politics and language.Many books and magzine which are related to expected nature at this young age support the idea of today's sepration which are encourage the youths.The importance of boy athletes used to be clear example of hidden curriculum.Student imagination and creativity are also developed by some other activities.Education is the process of facilitating learning,kowledge,skills,belief and habits.Education can take place in formal or informal setting an any experience that has a formative effect on the way one think,feels and acts may be considered educational.Education is more important for every students and children.The influence of this can lead to a negative self image or hatred for reading.These researchers discuss how the student increase the knowledge related to nature and many others areas.Their goal has been to raise the general awareness of hidden education curriculum in our school in order to make education system progressive and accessible to students of all culture ,linguistic and many other areeas which are related to ediucation system.The\""
